This repository is my very first website code, designed for a wellness clinic. 
The clinic provides acupuncture and massage services, using different modern techniques and methods. <br>
A simple, minimalistic and easily navigated website for clients to get an understanding of what this clinic offers and how to get in touch with Golden Lotus.

## Improving Features


**About Us page**
- When it comes to a website that offers wellness services it is often interesting for the customer to know a little more about the people who work there. A section including portraits, career history and something personal would help grow the business. It would make the website come off as more professional all while also personal. 

**Hamburger menu**
- Initially there was a hamburger menu being crafted but the website later took a shift in a different direction. I went with a different design idea where the hamburger menu wasn't included. However it would make it easier to navigate, both on pc and mobile, wherever you are on the pages. It's a very useful and comfortable tool but has many ways of being implemented and coded, therefore it's an improvement to be made in the future once Im more familiar with HTML and CSS.

**Price list**
- Would provide further clarity regarding exact treatment options and what those would cost.

## Testing

  style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 300px">

A perfect score when testing for errors and warnings in the [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/). <br>
Initially it did react to several misuses of slashes and some stray endtags, after a few quickfixes I got the desired result.

  Results came out in Swedish but it states that there were no issues with my CSS while testing it in [CSS  validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
